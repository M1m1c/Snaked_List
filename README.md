# Snaked_List

By Ludvig Baummann Olsson

This is a 3D snake battle royal simulation made in unity 2020.3.
The game features an arena where all snakes compete over who can survive the longest and eat the most fruit within a timer.
It features A* pathfinding that the snakes use to navigate the arena, as well as a continuously updating score board that is sorted using selection sort.

To setup how many snakes to spawn, drag the slider that appears on the left side of the screen.
To set up for how long the session should go on, drag the slider on the right side of the screen.
When ready click the start button near the middle bottom of the screen and watch the snakes battle.
